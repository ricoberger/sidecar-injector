## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user. This

## specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after
## 'resources:'.
##
resources: {}
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi

  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
